Hey there and thank you for opening an issue!

Please help us keep the number of opened issues under control.

Do the checklist before filing an issue:

- [ ] Is this something you can **debug and fix**? Send a pull request! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome.
- [ ] Have a usage question? Ask in our [slack channel](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/goa/) (Need an invite? get one [here](https://gophersinvite.herokuapp.com/)).

None of the above, create a bug report

Make sure to add **all the information needed to understand the bug** so that someone can help. If the info is missing we'll add the 'Needs more information' label and close the issue until there is enough information.

- [ ] Describe the expected outcome versus the actual outcome.
- [ ] Provide a **complete and simple design** (one that the tool can be run on directly) that reproduces the bug.
- [ ] What's the **version** of goa you're using?
- [ ] Are you using Mac, Linux or Windows?
